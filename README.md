# Degree Verification Tool

## 1. Project Title
Blockchain-Powered Degree Verification System with AI Validation

## 2. Project Description
This project provides a secure, tamper-proof solution for verifying academic degrees using blockchain technology. Institutions can add degree information, and employers/verifiers can check the authenticity of degrees either through manual verification or AI-powered validation. The system tracks the verification status of each degree throughout its lifecycle.

## 3. Project Vision
To revolutionize academic credential verification by creating a decentralized, transparent system that:
- Eliminates degree fraud
- Reduces verification costs and time
- Provides multiple verification methods (manual and AI)
- Maintains a permanent, immutable record of credentials
- Gives real-time status updates on verification processes

## 4. Future Scope
- Integration with university databases for automatic degree registration
- NFT-based digital diplomas
- Multi-chain verification system
- Reputation scoring for institutions based on verification patterns
- Automated background check integration
- ZK-proof based verification for privacy-preserving checks
- Mobile app for easy degree sharing and verification

## 5. Contract Address
[To be deployed on Stacks mainnet/testnet]

## Additional Enhancement Ideas:

1. **Digital Diploma NFTs**: Issue NFTs to graduates that represent their degrees
2. **Verification Marketplace**: Allow third-party verifiers to earn tokens for verifying degrees
3. **Institution Reputation System**: Rate universities based on verification success rates
4. **Graduate Portfolio**: Build a comprehensive profile of all academic achievements
5. **Job Matching**: Connect verified graduates with employers automatically
6. **Lifetime Learning Record**: Track all certifications and courses beyond degrees
7. **Multi-language Support**: For international degree verification
8. **Smart Contract Notaries**: Allow authorized notaries to verify degrees
9. **Revocation System**: Handle cases where degrees need to be revoked
10. **Gasless Verification**: For institutions to cover verification costs
